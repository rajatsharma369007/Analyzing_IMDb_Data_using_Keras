# Analyzing IMDb Data using Keras

## Introduction
In this notebook, I have analysed movie dataset of IMDb which has 25000 movie reviews. Each review comes with label 0 and 1. The goal is to create a model that will predict the sentiment of the review, based on the words in the review. I am using keras for building the model.

## Dataset
I have loaded the dataset from scikit-learn's dataset package.  
<code>from keras.datasets import imdb</code>

## Installation
* numpy  
<code>conda install numpy</code>
* keras  
<code>conda install keras</code>
* matplotlib  
<code>conda install matplotlib</code>

## Accuracy
Test score = 0.85788

## Issue/Bug
Please open issues on github to report bugs or make feature requests.

## Contribution
If you are interested in improving the code, please open an issue first to describe the task you are planning to do. For small fixes (a few lines of change) feel free to open pull requests directly.
